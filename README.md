The case study revolves around risk analytics in banking and financial services.
Specifically, we aim to understand how data can be leveraged to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
Our focus is on identifying patterns that indicate whether a client may have difficulty paying their loan installments.

These patterns can guide actions such as:
Denying the loan: For high-risk applicants.
Reducing the loan amount: To mitigate risk.
Lending at a higher interest rate: For riskier clients.
The ultimate goal is to ensure that consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.
